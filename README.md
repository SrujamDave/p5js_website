# p5js_website

## About the project

This project aims to build a website, in which are embedded multiple sketches created using the p5.js javascript library. The sketches themselves
are meant to display interesting mathematical behavior, whether by simulating systems found in nature, showing self-similarly, or displaying 
complex emergent behavior from simple rules. The website embeds each sketch within a details tag that contains description and context for each sketch.

The website itself is hosted using github pages, and can be visited [here](srujamdave.github.io/p5_jswebsite/sketches.html).
